# BEST BLOG

Welcome to the place you can upload whatever you want!!

## Description

BEST BLOG is a modern web application that allows users to create and share blog posts. Express yourself freely by uploading text, images, and other content in a user-friendly environment.

##Just before
The data is fetched from json-placeholder, so I had to generate names and images ( not too much :) ) .
You may see duplicates of images and names, it's on purpose...
